# Tagalog-Reader
## What is the project? 
### The Tagalog Reader website is a website that I've decided to create to help me in my journey of learning Tagalog. When opening the site, there will be two similar boxes and two buttons. Only the top box can be interacted with initially & will be used to type or paste tagalog. The buttons will consist of a submit & and a clear option. Clearing will essentially just refresh the page to start with a clean slate. Submitting will copy what was inputed in the top box and reshow it in the second box; however, each word is actually a button. When clicked, a pop up will show the definition of the word chosen to help break down complex sentences without needing a full translation from an unreliable translator. Having a design like this will allow quick assistance when reading sentences without interupting the flow of reading too much. The definitions will be taken from Tagalog.com's API since their dictionary has helped me tremendously through my studies.
